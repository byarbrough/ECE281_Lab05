##Part 1

###Testbench - The Initial Program

Here is the initial testbench simulation:

![alt text](https://github.com/byarbrough/ECE281_Lab05/blob/master/sim_0_to_165ns.PNG?raw=true "PRISM Testbench")

As you can see, there are a lot of signals in there. Each segment is labled in accordance with this state diagram:



####The Big Picture
So what does this program do?

###Controller State Walkthrough


#### When I wired everything up to the topshell, Part 1 worked as expected. HUZZAH!

##Part 2

####This was a little more of a hassel

##Questions
I know this is a boring, uncreative way of doing this, but it's project season:

1.	When the controller’s current state is “FETCH,” what is the status of the following control lines:

    a. PCLd - 
    
    b. IRLd - 
    
    c. ACCLd - 

2.	The current state is Decode LoAddr and the IR contains “OUT.”  What are the control signals are asserted, and what will the next state be?







3.	What are the three status signals sent from the PRISM datapath to the PRISM controller?







4.	Why is it important that ACCLd signal be active during the execute state for the ADDI instruction?







5.	What changes are necessary to the PRISM datapath to add another instruction (SUBI, which would subtract an immediate value from the accumulator) to the instruction set?
